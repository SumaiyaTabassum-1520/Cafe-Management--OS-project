Will & Lou's Café Problem
# Cafe-Management--OS-project
In the quaint village where "Me Before You" by Jojo Moyes is set, a lovely little café called "Will 
& Lou's" has opened. This charming café is inspired by the beautiful marriage between Will 
Traynor and Louisa Clark and is adorned with bumblebee tights and quirky decorations. The café 
has a limited number of tables, and they offer a unique service: customers can borrow books to 
read while enjoying their coffee and treats.
To maintain the serene atmosphere of the café and ensure a smooth borrowing experience for 
customers, the following aspects need to be managed:
1. Allowing customers to enter the café while making sure there is a table available for them 
to sit.
2. Managing the borrowing and returning process of books, ensuring customers only take 
available books.
3. Ensuring customers leave a table once they finish reading and enjoying their treats, making 
room for new customers.
4. Synchronizing the book inventory, so the availability status of each book is accurate.
